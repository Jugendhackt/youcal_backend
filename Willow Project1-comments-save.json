            "textDisplay": "@Kaleb Callahan \nIf I own a shoe factory and decide to expand it, I can write off the business expense of the construction and lower my tax payments, or you could consider it a lose of revenue to the state. When the construction is complete, my revenue will go up and so will the states. If I do not expand the state revenue and my revenue stay the same.\r\n\r\nThe oil revenues have been decreasing for decades. Without new drilling they will disappear in the near term. With new drilling the revenue will go up in the future.\r\n\r\nThe tribe that installed PV-Diesel system is 600 miles south of where the willow project is located. The tribe location might go a month with no daylight, whereas the Willow project area might go 3 months without daylight. I assume that they would need a larger investment in renewables, IF they want electricity. I also assume that it costs more money to get diesel to the Willow project area than the tribe in your linked article. IF there was no more diesel produced in Alaska and it had to be imported from a foreign country, I assume that it would cost even more.\r\n\r\nThe PV-diesel project cost a fifth of what the Willow project but only supplies enough energy to reduce one villages diesel consumption by 25%. To eliminate the usage in the one village would cost as much as the willow project, but of course most of that funding comes from taxpayers, not future profits from a private company. The state could spend a billion dollars per village to allow them to have renewable energy or they can lose a billion dollars in revenue but be able to tax wages, assets and products when the project is completed and receive much more than the lost revenues.\r\n\r\nThe state of California used to get a majority of the oil they use from Alaska but due to the decline in production in Alaska, they now get 60% of the oil they use from foreign countries. Without new drilling in Alaska (and California), the existing wells will be depleted, and California would have to get over 90% of its oil from foreign countries. The ships that transport foreign oil to California create more pollution than the entire transportation industry in California. The transition to EV will reduce the dependance on oil but at the same time increase the dependence on energy from other states. If the other states reduce their usage of fossil fuels like California does, California will have an energy shortage.\r\n\r\nThe US military is the biggest user of energy, more than most countries. Much of our imports come to the US by ships and planes. Do you foresee ships and civilian and military planes, as well as farm equipment transitioning to electricity generated by wind and solar? Will all the materials needed to make wind and solar be transported by renewable energy?\r\n\r\nFrom an article I read 5-10 years ago, the 13 largest ships generate more pollution than all the cars on the planet. \r\n\r\nSome countries, like Germany, have invested heavily in renewable, the result is that their emissions and energy costs have actually increased. The US is one of the few countries that are meeting their goals, by switching from coal to natural gas. For every reduction the US has made, China has added several times over. Many developing countries are increasing the usage of fossil fuels so that they to can have access to clean water and sanitary sewer. The usage of fossil fuels will exist long after 2030.",
            "textOriginal": "@Kaleb Callahan \nIf I own a shoe factory and decide to expand it, I can write off the business expense of the construction and lower my tax payments, or you could consider it a lose of revenue to the state. When the construction is complete, my revenue will go up and so will the states. If I do not expand the state revenue and my revenue stay the same.\r\n\r\nThe oil revenues have been decreasing for decades. Without new drilling they will disappear in the near term. With new drilling the revenue will go up in the future.\r\n\r\nThe tribe that installed PV-Diesel system is 600 miles south of where the willow project is located. The tribe location might go a month with no daylight, whereas the Willow project area might go 3 months without daylight. I assume that they would need a larger investment in renewables, IF they want electricity. I also assume that it costs more money to get diesel to the Willow project area than the tribe in your linked article. IF there was no more diesel produced in Alaska and it had to be imported from a foreign country, I assume that it would cost even more.\r\n\r\nThe PV-diesel project cost a fifth of what the Willow project but only supplies enough energy to reduce one villages diesel consumption by 25%. To eliminate the usage in the one village would cost as much as the willow project, but of course most of that funding comes from taxpayers, not future profits from a private company. The state could spend a billion dollars per village to allow them to have renewable energy or they can lose a billion dollars in revenue but be able to tax wages, assets and products when the project is completed and receive much more than the lost revenues.\r\n\r\nThe state of California used to get a majority of the oil they use from Alaska but due to the decline in production in Alaska, they now get 60% of the oil they use from foreign countries. Without new drilling in Alaska (and California), the existing wells will be depleted, and California would have to get over 90% of its oil from foreign countries. The ships that transport foreign oil to California create more pollution than the entire transportation industry in California.

If so you have nowhere to speak he is using petroleum-based products 24/7 so he's being a hypocrite and short-sighted Just like Miss Thornburg and all the other climate activists in this world ninety-nine percent of them drive cars and fly in airplanes for travel...,. If you really want to make a change quit using all petroleum products in every way and see how it goes for you that would be a possible. So Get out there and invent some new ways to make energy and make 100% carbon neutral products because that's all you can do to be an honest climate activist! You can start by walking everywhere you go. And now that Joe Biden has stopped all new oil leases not just on federal lands you're paying between 25 and 35% more for Castle weed and everything else \n you buy..... If you think for one minute America quit using petroleum products tomorrow that it would really change the pollution on Earth you're sadly mistaken. America has some of the strongest environmental laws in the world that's why we have the environmental protection agency. China and India pollute more pollution than all the other nations of the world. They are only picking up speed on all carbon releases between all their coal-burning plants and all the millions upon millions of cars they use everyday. And may have almonds in zero environmental laws. So wake up kids until we get every nation on Earth to stop using petroleum products this situation will never end,",

Personally I'm torn on the subject and will definitely have to do my own research to look into it more in depth to form a more informed stance, but based on just the information you provided, I find myself in favor of it.\n\nIt seems like the developers have taken all the right precautions necessary to preserve the environment as much as possible given that it is the oil industry. But the benefit of having American oil readily available and not having to rely on other countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia like you mentioned outweigh the environmental concerns in this situation, especially if it means boosting the economy by providing jobs and lowering the price of gas. And the way I look at it is that while I don't think its a bad thing to begin to move away from it where possible, oil use isn't going away anytime soon and its going to be extracted by these other countries anyways, so why should we continue to leave the ball in their court, when we can actually dictate the terms from which its extracted.\n\nAlso with pipelines they are in my opinion the most environmentally friendly way to transport oil and other substances that may be harmful to the environment especially if they are buried, which might not be possible as this is the tundra we are taking about, but in other cases like the Keystone pipeline there is essentially no maintenance required with basically 0 chance of a spillage barring any natural disaster or act of God. Hopefully it doesn't disrupt the ecosystem to much although I obviously know that it will interact with it to an extent that in my opinion is almost impossible to predict with certainty.\n\nI'm interested to hear your opinion on my stance being on the \"opposing side\" but I truly believe the best way to bring people together on matters like this, is to have a calm discussion about it. Once again great video, I'm looking forward to the next one! (Sorry for the novel lol)",

We're certainly alike in that regard! I think, for me, the associated infrastructure (roads, pipelines, heavy machinery, etc) and the impacts they will/have the potential to bring (localized air and water pollution, oil spills, habitat fragmentation and disturbance, impacts to subsistence lifestyles) to an incredibly fragile area and community are not worth the potential benefits. That's not to say I don't value energy independence and I certainly don't support lining the pockets of authoritarian regimes, it's just that with my own values and beliefs, I give the environmental impacts more weight.

I have worked in the village and lived there for a short time on that project. I have lived in Alaska to 27 years and am still there in Wasilla. This is my very 1st reply to a video on youtube, and I only post this reply because of the balanced presentation that you have made for us in this video. I support the project and wish to point out that the problems in bush Alaska do not come from the development, but from the bad choices of residents that chose to change their way of life after money becomes more available to them. Money does not come with instructions, and it can harm as well as help. I do not know if you have been to NPRA or the village, but to get a better understanding of the issues, you should travel there, meet the people, and live a week or more there. You will see for yourself what is there before Willow, and then could see what happens after Willow. Oil independence is important for America, and will become less important as we transition to different forms of transportation. That is many years away yet and we as a population need to patiently and carefully make the transition. The biggest thing that I look for in a presentation like this is the reason to protest the project. NIMBY is not a reason to deny a project now, just like it was not an acceptable reason when I served on the Wasilla Planning Commission several years ago. In closing, imagine a world today if all oil production stopped. Millions would starve and die, travel would cease as we know it, and it would still be many years before we could begin to return to a normal life as we know it today. Be careful what you wish for, as you might just get it! Again, thank you for a great presentation and I support your position of opposition to Willow.",

I would respectfully disagree that money is what caused the locals to change their way of life. I think there were forces at play they could not control and that oil and gas development was coming to these places regardless of whether or not they wanted them. Unfortunately, I think, the system thrust upon them forced them to accept that money in order to continue their way of life. Having never lived there or spoken with these communities, this is just my opinion of course. Just an observation I'm making from the outside. Overall, I think it's a pretty complicated situation with no easy answers. Thanks again for your comment.",
            "textOriginal": "Thanks for engaging in the dialogue here - I think that goes a long way to getting to the bottom of issues like this.

My own personal view is one of being aware of the reality and the ability to transition our energy outputs from fossil fuels to renewable.  There are still way too many shortcomings and thus risks in transitioning TOO fast.  The progress is highly promising, especially with the early announced scientific breakthrough involving fusion.  I do think that within the next 30 to 50 years, more progress will occur and something which we are yet even aware of will begin to make the transition fast tracked.  We've made tremendous strides in cleaning our outputs, I remember the golden yellow smog which CONSTANTLY covered the LA Basin in California, it's practically completely gone, and certainly is tremendously lessened from what it was in the 60's and 70's.  I lived in Ca in the 1980's, saw the impacts of cleaner and cleaner industrial and personal emissions.  My desire would be that if this project does go forward to it's 30 year completion, then the environmental and societal concerns can be closely monitored and adhered to regulations and verification of continued pre-cautions to the greatest extent possible.

Once again they say not here it diverts the water from one area or another. Now we are being told solar is the way. The impact of background heat caused by solar panels has not been properly and widely discussed. We are telling people about \"global warming\", but they are not being told that one acre of solar panels increases the ambient air temperature by 1 to 2 degrees.  That does not sound like much until we remember that is only one acre. In order to power a city which are only growing we would need multiple acres to power each city.

The second thing I want to say though is toward the end of this video you assert that it isn't your intention to tell people what to think, but how to think (which I agree with), but then you state how to think about ways to oppose this project. Yet a couple minutes before in the video you stated that there were very good reasons to go through with it. To me it comes across as a bit of double speak to say \"Both sides have very good arguments for WIllow\" then turn around and say \"We need to know how to think about opposing it because it needs to be opposed.\" That, to me, ended the video on a bit of a low note. Disclosure on my part, I fully believe in the development and promotion of alternative fuels, and would love to see us get to a point where dependence on oil is a thing of the past. At the same time though, there is no one alternative fuel that will satisfy every need. Until alternative fuels (notice the plural) are better developed, promoted, and integrated into our world, the best we can do is to do what we have been doing, but striving to be more responsible with how it's been done. I am no fan of Biden (and just before anyone accuses me I wasn't a fan of Trump, of Obama, or Bush), but scaling back the project is a step toward that responsibility.",

We have huge reserves of coal also, but because the electric industry won't clean up emissions, coal is a hard sell.

AAAAAAAAGH!\n\nIt's completely f*cked me over. I just want to get a simple job, get some money to cover my car insurance and all the gas I'm burning (Because my parents pay for it all and I feel kinda guilty about it) But I just can't. I get it, anyone under 16 shouldn't be allowed to work, because that is too big too soon, but after that? The hour cap should be 8 hours, or it's pointless to even make it legal for minors to work in the first place! Places already don't want to hire me because I'm not 18 or older, but now they REALLY don't because I can only work half the f*cking day! It's stupid as sh*t!",

The climate was quite stable up until the 1950s. You know what happened then? The greens decided to support our switch to monocrop rows with pesticides and herbicides en masse. And we followed. \n\nYep. Monocrops. They destroy our top soil which lets carbons locked in the Earth go free. On top of them, we began using more insecticides. Which is annihilating the bug population which means our pollinators are also being poisoned. \n\nThe purpose of top soil is to trap carbons back in the soil so it can be spread around and reformed deep in the Earth. But irrigation and monocrops dig up this precious top soil and let all the captured carbon go free. Deadly agriculture practices we let flourish world wide. \n\nThankfully they can be repaired in just 10 years. How? Look to New Mexico and South African farms. Some farmers have begun doing something known as regenerative farming. By letting loose hundreds of cattle and rotating them in small paddocks, the cattle stomp the soil down, add carbon back with their manure, stomp that deeper in to reform top soil, and by moving they give the soil time to dry and solidify back up before repeating again. And again. \n\nThis lets planted deep root grasses stretch further into the soil and grow longer by passing nutrients around. And it has turned dry, waterless, brown dusty soils and grassless regions into a wet, black soil, grass rich pasture in just 9 years. Deserts gone. By the power of cows. About 1 cow per 1 acre. Which means it is efficient and produces a ton of food. And it is being done in Africa. In the areas near the desert. Where it is turning dying soils back to peak health.\n\nThis should be the norm world over. Millions of cattle on open land, not monocrops. Replace the monocrops with cows and we can trap so much more carbon back where it belongs.",
            "textOriginal": "The fear of the Willow Project by green groups has always amused me beyond belief, because it was their predecessors that started the climate fumble. \n\nWe have been burning large amounts of oil and coal for over 150 years, though burning it is thousands of years old. The climate was quite stable up until the 1950s. You know what happened then? The greens decided to support our switch to monocrop rows with pesticides and herbicides en masse. And we followed. \n\nYep. Monocrops. They destroy our top soil which lets carbons locked in the Earth go free. On top of them, we began using more insecticides. Which is annihilating the bug population which means our pollinators are also being poisoned. \n\nThe purpose of top soil is to trap carbons back in the soil so it can be spread around and reformed deep in the Earth.

We all wanted to pay for school sports, sports gear, backpacks, fishing gear, archery equipment, bikes, videogames, or fireworks on the fourth. Things which at times our parents couldn't afford. The ability to work as a kid is not slavery, it's financial freedom. Refusing children the right to work is an awful thing in my mind. I was lucky and had parents I could work for, but some kids and families could never do that. Should there be punishments for overworking kids? Absolutely. Is a kid being overworked just because they have a job? Absolutely not. Legal working age should be 8, and if an 8 year old can't perform the manual labor, don't hire them!!!\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21",

Not talking about the good parents that actually love and care for their kids lol, I'm talking about the ones who will beat you bloody for having accidentally spilled water on the floor(like my stepmother did) \n\nFor kids like me, California's labor laws saved many of us from just ending ourselves, it gave us assistance to get out from under our parents control simply by allowing us to get a job at 16-17 without permission",
